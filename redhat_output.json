Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of \ncreating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine \nwho will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file \npermissions.\n\nWhen discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are \nnot constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have \nalready been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are \nnot prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information \nto other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory \nAccess Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this \nrequirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a \nsubject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity \nlevel, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same \nsensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the \ninformation is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be \nrequired to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional \ndefinitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that \nlimitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.\n\nBy enabling the \nfs.protected_hardlinks kernel parameter, users can no longer create soft or hard links to \nfiles they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigate vulnerabilities based on \ninsecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector \nexploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().\n\nThe sysctl --system command will load settings \nfrom all system configuration files.
